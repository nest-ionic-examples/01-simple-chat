== Nest Application

This tutorial starts with the actual backend for our app. Itâ€™s good to have some Node skills so you could potentially build your own little backend from time to time. First of all we create a new http://docs.nestjs.com/[NestJs] app for our backend:


[source,sh,options="nowrap"]
----
nest new simple-chat-api && cd simple-chat-api
----

then install `@nestjs/websockets`:

[source,sh,options="nowrap"]
----
npm i @nestjs/websockets`
----

All of our functions are wrapped inside a gateway class, which only listen for events once a client connects to the server.

We listen for `set-nickname` and `add-message` and whenever our clients sends out these events the server does something.

If our clients send a new message, the server emit that message to everyone connected as a new object with text, the name of the sending user and a date. Also, we set the name of the socket connection if a users send his nickname.

Finally if a user disconnects, we inform everyone that somebody just left the room. To do all that we need to generate `gateways/messages.js`:

[source,sh,options="nowrap"]
----
nest g ga gateways/messages
----

then open `src/gateways/messages/messages.gateway.ts` and change it for next code:

[source,ts,options="nowrap"]
----
include::src/gateways/messages/messages.gateway.ts[]
----
<1> set a function for handle disconnect events which is implemented because of `OnGatewayDisconnect` interface.
<2> set subscriber for `set-nickname` event.
<3> use `client.server.emit` to broadcast value to all clients
<4> set subscriber for `add-message` event.

Your NestJs backend with Socket.io is now ready! You can start it by running the command below and you should be able to reach it at http://localhost:3000

[source,sh,options="nowrap"]
----
npm start:dev
----
